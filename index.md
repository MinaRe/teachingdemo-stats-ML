# Statistical and Machine Learning

## Course Overview
This course provides a bridge between classical statistical inference and modern machine learning. Machine learning (ML) is a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and experience rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behaviour by hand. ML has become increasingly central both in AI as an academic field and industry. This course provides a broad introduction to some of the most commonly used ML algorithms. It also introduces vital algorithmic principles that will serve as a foundation for more advanced courses, such as Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning and Deep Learning.

We start with nearest neighbours, the canonical non-parametric model. We then turn to parametric models: linear regression, logistic regression, soft max regression, and neural networks. We then move on to unsupervised learning, focusing in particular on probabilistic models, but also principal components analysis and K-means. Finally, we cover the basics of reinforcement learning.

This course will delve deep into the mathematical foundations of machine learning and will focus on implementing, understanding and debugging software programs for building machine learning models from data. This class will make heavy use of the mathematical and statistical pre-requisites for this class. Students are expected to be comfortable with technical material from multivariate probability theory, multivariable calculus and linear algebtra enough to manipulate them towards the description, design and implementation of learning algorithms for machine learning models.
